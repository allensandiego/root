# Welcome to my Page

I am a programmer by profession. Mostly related on ERP. I do a lot of sql queries/reports and stored procedures on the back-end side but I am also proficient in unix scripting. On the front-end side, I've dealt mostly Oracle E-Business Suite, Oracle Application Express and other Oracle products.

When I'm not at work, I still do a bit of programming, mainly building android applications, a little bit of spring boot applications, setup home labs, home servers for personal use and some other things that I might think of.

If I'm too lazy to program, I revert to woodworking, metal works and other DIY stuff. Not an expert though and most of my builds are average quality.
